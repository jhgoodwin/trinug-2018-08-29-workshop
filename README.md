_Bug Addiction - Break Your Habit_

In this workshop, we will explore together some of the common ways that software developers accidentally add bugs in our software. Today, we study a twist on this problem. Not only will these be examples of accidental bugs, but bugs the software developer intentionally adds.

## Basic Instructions

* Clone this Repo
* Each example will be in order:
  * Example.01
  * Example.02
  * so on.
* Inside each folder is a mini-project
* Open the README.md in the folder to read about the scenario.
  * As we progress through the workshop, the presenter will describe the example and walk us through.
